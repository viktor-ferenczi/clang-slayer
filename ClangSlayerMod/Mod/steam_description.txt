[h1]Clang Slayer[/h1]

Disables or detaches mechanical connection bases (piston, rotor, hinge) if they would introduce clang forces.

This mod is useful to block the use of all kind of clang based solutions (drives, weapons, etc.). 

This mod still allows for all reasonable uses of mechanical connections, for example in drilling rigs or cranes, as long as they are not "forced" into unrealistic positions/forces.

[h2]How to use[/h2]
[list]
[*] Add this mod to your world.
[*] Try to use a clang drive or weapon. They should not work.
[*] Try to build a drilling rig or a crane, it should work fine as long as not "forced".
[/list]

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
[list]
[*] Works in both single and multiplayer.
[*] Works in both creative and survival game.

[h2]Theory of operation[/h2]
This mod 
[list]
[*] tracks all mechanical connection bases and verifies all active ones every 10 ticks
[*] compares the expected head position and orientation with the actual one
[*] measures the strain (clang forces) from the difference in position and orientation
[*] disables mechanical bases when they start to induce slight clang
[*] detaches heads if keeping them would introduce serious clang forces

[h2]Commands[/h2]

[h2]Tunable parameters[/h2]
The mod generates a [code]ClangSlayer.ini[/code] file under the Storage folder of your world when it is first loaded. 
Look into that file for documentation of all settings. 
Uncomment the settings you want to change, the ones with default values are written as commented out (#).

[h2]Known issues[/h2]
[list]
[*] This mod may interfere with some programmable block scripts controlling mechanical base blocks every tick.
[*] Players attempting to overdrive mechanical connections may report that they are broken. 
[/list]

[h2]Troubleshooting[/h2]
[olist]
[*] Enable the Debug and Detail in settings in ClangSlayer.ini  
[*] Load the world (reload if already loaded)
[*] Look into the Space Engineers log, search for ClangSlayer
[*] Make sure the problem mechanical base blocks and their grids are named
[*] Reproduce the problem
[*] Find the problematic mechanical connections in the log by their name
[*] Check the position and axis errors measured
[*] Try to increase the relevant limits in the INI file slightly
